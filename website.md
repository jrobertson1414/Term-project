# Project Overview

Abir Sethi and John Robertson and two juniors at Babson College. For our final project, we were tasked with creating a program that would be useful and applicable in the real world. They are both passionate and avid music listeners, and are constantly playing their songs on shuffle on Spotify. Music is a very emotional thing, it can make you feel happy, sad, angry, excited, and other several emotions. If only there was a way to create playlists based on these emotions...

During this age of modern technology and coding, Abir and John wanted to use their entrepreneurial and innovative mindsets to develop a solution to this problem. Through this code, you have the ability to search songs on Genius.com and have those organized into a "happy" and "sad" playlist so that you know which songs to play given your current mood. 

This process may seem simple, but was actually a pretty difficult task. We were fortunate enough to discover and utilize the lyricsgenius package by ________ on GitHub. This package aided our coding process, as it provided us with the backend solution to finding songs and lyrics on Genius.com using our own personal API. 

You may be thinking, how were they able to figure out whether a song was happy or sad? Isn't that something that only humans can do?

Yes, but NLTK Sentiment Analysis can also accomplish this, by scanning the lyrics and assigning it a positive, negative, and neutral sentiment score. If the song is deemed more positive in terms of it's lyrics, then it is added to the "happy" playlist, and if it is deemed more negative in terms of it's lyrics, then it is added to the "sad" playlist. 

We are extremely proud of the work that we completed and are really excited for you to explore this project and use it for your Spotify playlist creation endevours.
